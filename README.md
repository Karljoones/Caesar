# Caesar

This program uses the caesar shift cipher to encode strings of data

<i>To use:</i>
<ul>
<li>The user enters the string</li>
<li>The user enters the key to which they want the string encoded</li>
<li>The program will output the encoded string, followed by the key that is needed to decode the string</li>
</ul>

This program can be run through command line, though the code is commented out.

<p>
The program does not run as intended. My aim was to have a user interface that would allow the user to encode and decode the strings from the same screen using the same key. However, due to a mishap, the keys must be seperate from each other. The <code> decode() </code> currently is not used butt its effect is still the same.
