# Caesar

This program uses the caesar shift cipher to encode strings of data

To use:
<ul>
<li>The user enters the string</li>
<li>The user enters the key to which they want the string encoded</li>
<li>The program will output the encoded string, followed by the key that is needed to decode the string</li>
</ul>

This program can be run through command line, though the code is commented out.
